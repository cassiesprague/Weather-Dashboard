# Weather Dashboard



## Description
This application allows users to search a city and have it generate the current date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. It also shows users the 5 day forecast for that city and used local storage to store the cities that they have looked up. 

My motivation for creating this application was an easy way to show the upcoming weather since I travel frequently. It is also helpful since I like to work outside and let my dog play outside, so I like to know what upcoming days will be nice to be outside.
