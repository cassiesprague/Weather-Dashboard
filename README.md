# Weather Dashboard



## Description
This application allows users to search a city and have it generate the current date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. It also shows users the 5 day forecast for that city and used local storage to store the cities that they have looked up. 

My motivation for creating this application was an easy way to show the upcoming weather since I travel frequently. It is also helpful since I like to work outside and let my dog play outside, so I like to know what upcoming days will be nice to be outside.

## Usage
Once you have your own copy of the application, open it in your preferred browser. To search for a weather in the city of your choosing, go under Search for a City and type the city. Hit the search button and view the weather for that city. Repeat these steps for any additional cities you want to know the weather for. The cities you have searched will be saved and appear under the search bar so you can navigate to them easier without needing to retype the city in the search bar again.
